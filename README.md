# GalaxyLS
The GalaxyLS is the open source simulator for solving Fermi paradox 
using known rational assumptions concerning the Great Silence of the Universe. 
The input data are taken mainly from the Hipparcos and Gaia astronomical data
and converted to SQLite tables to quantify the random datasets prapared by Monte-Carlo method. 
The simulator is using a convolution of birth and death of various spectral star classes   
for habitable exoplanets with intelligent life. 
The interface designed with Embarcadero RAD Studio's VCL library and rendered 
using GLScene graphic engine.
Common requirements: Windows 10/11 32/64 bits OS.
