The FermiPX is the open source simulator for solving Fermi paradox 
using a suit of hypothesis concerning the Great Silence of Universe. 
The input data are taken mainly from the Hipparcos and Gaia astronomical data
and converted to SQLite tables to quantify the random datasets prapared by Monte-Carlo method. 
The simulator is using the convolution of birth and birth and death of various spectral classes of stars
