# FermiPX
The software FermiPX is an open source intelligent life simulator for solving Fermi paradox using a suit of rational hypothesis concerning the Great Silence of Cosmos. The input data are taken mainly from the SIMBAD astronomical database converted to SQLite tables or verified like random datasets by Monte-Carlo method for galovoxels of spiral arms, bulge and Milki Way Halo. The simulator is tightly related to the formation and evolution of various spectral classes of stars and its exoplanetospheres in space and time. It's interface designed with Embarcadero RAD Studio's VCL/FMX libraries and rendered using GLScene graphic engine with advanced visual components.
