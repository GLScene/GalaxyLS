# FermiPX
The FermiPX is an open source intelligent life simulator for solving Fermi paradox 
using a suit of rational hypothesis concerning the Great Silence of Cosmos. 
The input data are taken mainly from the SIMBAD astronomical database https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/ 
and converted to SQLite tables or changed with random datasets by Monte-Carlo method for galovoxels 
in the spiral arms, bulge and Milki Way Halo. 
The simulator is tightly related to the formation and evolution of various spectral classes of stars 
and its exoplanetospheres in space and time. 
It's interface designed with Embarcadero RAD Studio's VCL library and rendered 
using GLScene graphic engine with advanced visual components and programming tools.
Common requirements: Windows 32/64 bits OS with OpenGL support.
